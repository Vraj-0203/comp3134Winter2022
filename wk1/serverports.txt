(1) Web server ports are the logical endpoints of a network connection that is used to exchange information between a web server and a web client. ... When data is exchanged through the Internet between a web client and a web server, they need to establish a mutual connection between them.
(2) Port numbers range from 0 to 65535, but only port numbers 0 to 1023 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports.
(3) Using the above formula youâ€™ll see that the smallest four-digit number, 1000, requires 10 bits, and the largest four-digit number, 9999, requires 14 bits. The number of bits varies between those extremes. For example, 1344 requires 11 bits, 2527 requires 12 bits, and 5019 requires 13 bits.
